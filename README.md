# Program Name: Transfer function model measurement system verification
## Project: Transfer Function Modeling Approach for MRI Safety Assessment of Medical Devices

### Description:

The project code was prepared to accompany the FDA OSEL Regulatory
Science Tool for in vitro transfer function model validation using a
tabletop E-field generator.

Please refer to our paper [1] for more details on in vitro transfer
function model validation.

### Acknowledgment: 
The normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) calculation and acceptance criteria 
were adapted from Dr. Tolga Goren (IT'IS Foundation, Switzerland, goren@itis.swiss)'s 
Jupyter notebook,'PiX-PostPro_v20230725_TG.py, version 20230725'.

1. About the Catalog of Regulatory Science Tools \
The enclosed tool is part of the [Catalog of Regulatory Science Tools](https://cdrh-rst.fda.gov), which provides a peer-reviewed resource for
stakeholders to use where standards and qualified Medical Device Development Tools (MDDTs) do not yet exist.
These tools do not replace FDA-recognized standards or MDDTs. This catalog collates a variety of regulatory science tools
that the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health's (CDRH) Office of Science and Engineering Labs (OSEL) developed.
These tools use the most innovative science to support medical device development and patient access to safe and effective medical devices.
If you are considering using a tool from this catalog in your marketing submissions, note that these tools have not been qualified as
[Medical Device Development Tools](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-development-tools-mddt) and the FDA has not evaluated
the suitability of these tools within any specific context of use. You may [request feedback or meetings for medical device submissions](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/requests-feedback-and-meetings-medical-device-submissions-q-submission-program) as part of the Q-Submission Program.
