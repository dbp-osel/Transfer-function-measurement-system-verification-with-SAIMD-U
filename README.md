Program Name: Transfer function model measurement system verification
Project: Transfer Function Modeling Approach for MRI Safety Assessment of Medical Devices

Description:

The project code was prepared to accompany the FDA OSEL Regulatory
Science Tool for in vitro transfer function model validation using a
tabletop E-field generator.

Please refer to our paper [1] for more details on in vitro transfer
function model validation.

Acknowledgment: 
The normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) calculation and acceptance criteria 
were adapted from Dr. Tolga Goren (IT'IS Foundation, Switzerland, goren@itis.swiss)'s 
Jupyter notebook,'PiX-PostPro_v20230725_TG.py, version 20230725'.
